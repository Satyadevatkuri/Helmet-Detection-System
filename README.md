# Helmet-Detection-System
A helmet detection system using OpenCV utilizes image preprocessing, object detection algorithms (like Haar cascades, HOG, YOLO, or SSD), and post-processing to identify helmets in images or video. OpenCV's rich functions and tools for image processing and machine learning integration.
